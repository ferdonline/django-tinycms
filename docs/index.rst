Stoat
=====

`Stoat`_ is a sleek, lightweight, pluggable CMS app for Django, built to work with
`Grappelli`_.

Stoat is like `flatpages`_ on steroids.  No, scratch that, Stoat isn't that bulky.  It's
more like flatpages on a good exercise routine.

If you want to know why you should use Stoat instead of one of the `many other
options`_, check out the :doc:`Why Stoat? </why>` page.

**At this moment Stoat is very much alpha software -- use it at your own risk!**

The source is `on BitBucket`_ and `on GitHub`_.  Pull requests are accepted from
either site.

Report issues on the GitHub `issue tracker`_.
