django-tinycms
==============

tinycms is a little Content Manager System for django based on stoat (https://github.com/sjl/stoat).
It is designed to be extremely simple, lightweight and intuitive for the creation of static pages with TinyMCE.

Although you might still create templates, the philosophy of tinycms is "content rules", and so you should be able to freely write and format your content.

tinycms ships with a basic title/content template which will do the trick for most of the cases.
